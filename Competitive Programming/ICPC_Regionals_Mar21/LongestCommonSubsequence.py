'''
You are given n strings, each a permutation of the first k upper-case 
letters of the alphabet.

String s is a subsequence of string t if and only if it is possible to 
delete some (possibly zero) characters from the string t to get the 
string s.

Compute the length of the longest common subsequence of all n strings.

Input
The first line of input contains two integers n (1≤n≤105) and k (1≤k≤26), 
where n is the number of strings, and the strings are all permutations 
of the first k upper-case letters of the alphabet.

Each of the next n lines contains a single string t. It is guaranteed 
that every t contains each of the first k upper-case letters of the 
alphabet exactly once.

Output
Output a single integer, the length of the longest subsequence that 
appears in all n strings.
