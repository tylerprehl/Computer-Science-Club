We were give 14 problems to solve, and 5 hours to do so. We got 4 problems 
correct, and due to our program/solving speeds, we got 62nd place out of 
85. If we had gotten:
 - 5 problems right, would've at least placed 26th
 - 6 problems right, would've at least placed 17th (possibly moved on with
   better program speeds) - given some time, I can figure out how to solve
   the 6 easiest problems (Rating Problems, Unread Messages, Dominating 
   Duos, Bad Packing, Missing Number, No Thanks)
 - 7 problems right, would've at least placed 12th (moved on)

Types of problems I keeps seeing show up (that I can't solve (fast)):
1) in a given scenario, there is a HUGE permutation of possible routes, get 
   the most efficient route (Ant Typing, Longest Common Subsequence, 
   Town Patrol, Booby Trapped Escape)
2) get all possible permutations FAST (Typing Robot)
3)
